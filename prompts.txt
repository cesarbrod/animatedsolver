The programs in this folder have been created with the help of claude.ai.
Here are the prompts I used and some comments.

Prompt 1

You will write a path solving problem in python, proposing search techniques to be tested when going from point A to point B in a maze. The maze will be a text file representing a bidimensional maze where empty cells (blank spaces) are portions of a possible path and X cells are walls. When I execute the program you must first ask for the txt file containing the representation of the maze.

The result did not consider where my python binary was located, so here is the next prompt.

Prompt 2

The program works fine after I added the first line telling it where the python executable was. From now on, add this first line on the program in our next iteractions:

#!/home/brod/scripts/venv/bin/python

And now I want you to illustrate the paths being followed for all of the algorithms proposed.

Prompt 3 - adding statistics

When comparing all algorithms, show statistics on a table containing the following columns: Algorithm, Path Length, Nodes Explored, Time (s). Also, show the same statistics even if I choose to run an specific algorithm.

Prompt 4 - adding animation

Perfect, would you now provide an animation of the algorithms being executed so a user can actually see the steps being performed by the algorithm in a nice visual way? For every animation, provide the name of the algorithm being executed at the top of the animation. Still, provide the same statistics as you are already doing.
